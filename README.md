# Environment

- all files runs in env named "tf" except for "SHAP.ipynb", which runs in env "SHAP". There are version conflicts between those too environments, please notice. 

- The Django App requires env tf, remember to activate tf before "runserver". 

- packages installed in "tf" please see "./tf_packages.yml"

- packages installed in "SHAP" please see "./SHAP_packages.yml"

```python
conda env create -f ***.yml
```



# Dir ./models and ./data

- Because the datasets and .h5 files are oversized, I tried but failed to upload them to GitHub, I decide to upload them into OneDrive and then share the link. The datasets have been pressed and stored in ".zip" files.
